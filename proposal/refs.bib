    abstract = {Gene expression programming, a genotype/phenotype genetic algorithm
(linear and ramified), is presented here for the first time as a new
technique for the creation of computer programs. Gene expression
programming uses character linear chromosomes composed of genes
structurally organized in a head and a tail. The chromosomes function as
a genome and are subjected to modification by means of mutation,
transposition, root transposition, gene transposition, gene
recombination, and one- and two-point recombination. The chromosomes
encode expression trees which are the object of selection. The creation
of these separate entities (genome and expression tree) with distinct
functions allows the algorithm to perform with high efficiency that
greatly surpasses existing adaptive techniques. The suite of problems
chosen to illustrate the power and versatility of gene expression
programming includes symbolic regression, sequence induction with and
without constant creation, block stacking, cellular automata rules for
the density-classification problem, and two problems of boolean concept
learning: the 11-multiplexer and the GP rule problem.},

At present, no one system is capable of supporting the range of uses for which potential-field data are collected, and one emphasis for future development is the ability to translate between the different representations that are used.},

@incollection{numMethIntro,
    abstract = {The complete arrangement of Âµm-mm scale structures or elements in a rock is alternatively called microstructure , fabric , or texture . These structures involve grain sizes, grain shapes, grain boundary shapes, the subgrain structure, distribution of mineral phases, lattice orientations, etc. (Fig. 1.1). There is, unfortunately, no consensus of what term to use for the whole arrangement of all these elements. For example, some use texture to only denote the lattice orientation distribution, ignoring the other elements of the arrangement. Others use texture in a wider sense, as the term foam texture indicates: a microstructure where the grains look like the bubbles in a foam. Most geologists mean roughly the same when they use the term microstructure : this is what you see in a thin section with an optical microscope. This is also how the term is mostly used in this book. However, materials scientists usually think of a much smaller scale when they use microstructure . Microstructures in rocks are important to geologists for two reasons: firstly, to find out the history of a particular rock, and secondly, to understand processes in rocks and to predict rock properties.},

    abstract = {A model is a way to describe and usually simplify some process(es) or phenomenon one tries to understand. This can be constructed in words, as a physical object (e.g. a model of the Alps made of plaster), but usually in a mathematical way (by a set of equations). Sometimes, the equations and the system we want to apply them on (together the  â modelâ) are relatively simple and the equations can be solved on the back of an envelope. In that case there is an analytical solution. In many cases, however, the model is too complex to solve all the equations on a piece of paper, and we have to resort to computers to solve the equations.},
